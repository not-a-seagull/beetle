# beetle

Beetle is a (currently very incomplete) graphics framework built around the idea of looking and feeling native. Wherever possible, Beetle should rely on system-provided toolkits and drawing software. A secondary goal is to be procedural and work exactly and you intend it. Nothing should be hidden in a black box, and Beetle should rely on the model of calling functions in order to do things.

I am currently developing the X11 backend for Beetle (called "flutterbug"). It is not in a working state yet; feel free to fork the repo and poke around with the code.
